# msds600_autoML_project
 
PyCaret, an AutoML library, to analyze and predict customer churn. It starts with data loading and preprocessing, followed by installation and setup of PyCaret. And found Logistic Regression as the best model with "contract" as a key feature.

* Data Loading: We began by loading our preprocessed dataset from week 2, where everything had already been converted into numeric format.

- PyCaret Setup: We proceeded to set up PyCaret, an AutoML library, to automate various tasks. This included installing it and configuring it to work with our dataset. PyCaret streamlines processes like data preprocessing and offers numerous customization options.

- Model Comparison: Next, we utilized PyCaret to compare several machine learning models, aiming to identify the best-performing one for our churn prediction task. 

- Model Evaluation: We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the top model, including generating visualizations and examining metrics like accuracy. This in-depth assessment provided a clear understanding of the model's performance.

- Making Predictions: We demonstrated how to make predictions using the trained model. This capability allows us to predict churn on new data, a crucial functionality for our analysis.

- Model Saving and Loading: To ensure future usability, we explored how to save the best model as a pickle file. This step is vital for potential model deployment.

- Creating a Python Module: Finally, we suggested creating a Python module for efficient model deployment across different environments. This approach enhances the versatility of our churn prediction model.
